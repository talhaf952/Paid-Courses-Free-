antivirus Evasion:


Antivirus evasion refers to techniques used by malware authors to evade detection by antivirus software. These techniques help malware remain undetected, allowing it to:

1. Infect systems
2. Steal sensitive data
3. Conduct malicious activities


Types of Antivirus Evasion:


1. Code Obfuscation: Disguising malware code to prevent signature-based detection.
2. Encryption: Concealing malware code within encrypted files or communications.
3. Polymorphism: Constantly changing malware code to evade signature-based detection.
4. Metamorphism: Modifying malware code to change its behavior and evade detection.
5. Anti-Debugging: Techniques to prevent debuggers from analyzing malware.
6. Anti-Emulation: Techniques to prevent emulators from analyzing malware.
7. Code Injection: Injecting malware into legitimate processes.
8. Fileless Malware: Residing in memory only, without writing to disk.


Evasion Techniques:


1. Packers and Crypters: Compressing or encrypting malware to evade detection.
2. Code Cave Injection: Injecting malware into existing executable files.
3. API Hooking: Manipulating API calls to conceal malware activity.
4. Kernel-Mode Rootkits: Hiding malware in kernel mode.
5. User-Mode Rootkits: Hiding malware in user mode.
